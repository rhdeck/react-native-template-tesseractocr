# react-native-template-tesseractocr

React Native template for demoing functionality in [react-native-tesseract](https://npmjs.com/package/react-native-tesseract)

# Prerequisites

1. Since this is an iOS project, needs to be run on MacOS with XCode installed
2. XCode command line tools need to be installed (usually not a problem)
3. Cocoapods needs to be installed

# Usage

```
react-native init mytestapp --template tesseractocr
```

(Replace `mytestapp` with whatever you want to name your app)

# Suggestion

Run following in your package for easier testing (from your project root):

```
react-native setdevteam
react-native run-ios --device
```

# Important Note

Like the plugin, this project is iOS only at this time.
